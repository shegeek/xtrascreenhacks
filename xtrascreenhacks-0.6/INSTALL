The configure script is mostly up and running. It and its inputs are hacked 
versions of the ones that originally came with XScreensaver. The resulting 
Makefile should at least create the binaries and install them along with the 
xml configurators and man pages, although most of the other targets will not 
be useable (and may not even apply to you).

One mistake that configure will almost certainly make will be to check for
things that aren't needed for the hacks. If you installed XScreensaver from a
tarball, this shouldn't be a problem since everything will already be on your
system from that.

If the Makefiles and config.h are ok, then simply run:

$ ./configure
$ make

to generate the binaries. They will be in the hacks and hacks/glx directories.

If you have XScreensaver installed by some means other than the tarball
(ex. from a Debian package), you will want to pass some options to the
configure script, like this:

$ ./configure  --with-hackdir=/usr/lib/xscreensaver --with-configdir=/usr/share/xscreensaver/config

Run

$ ./configure --help

for more details.

Once the binaries are built, give yourself write permission on your 
desired installation directories and run:

$ make install

If this fails, you will need to copy the files to their target directories
by hand. Search for deluxe, deluxe.xml, and deluxe.1 (or deluxe.man, 
deluxe.6x.gz, etc) using locate, find, or whereis to figure out where they
should go. The binaries and xml files must be in the correct directories
to work properly with xscreensaver-demo.


You will need to add entries to your .xscreensaver file by hand.
Open $HOME/.xscreensaver in your favorite text editor and paste
the following lines into the "programs" section:

--snip----------------
-                       "Daisy" daisy -root                                 \n\
-                     "Twinkle" twinkle -root                               \n\
-GL:                    "Flyer" flyer -root                                 \n\
-GL:		       "Berlin-Uhr" berlinuhr -root				                \n\
-GL:		             "Soma" soma -root				                    \n\
-GL:		          "Skylark" skylark -root				                \n\
-GL:		          "Craters" craters -root				                \n\
--snip----------------

Then run xscreensaver-demo to activate and configure the hacks. If 

If you don't have XScreensaver at all, just enjoy the hacks in an X window.

If make install worked for you, type

$ make uninstall

when you no longer want the new screen hacks.
