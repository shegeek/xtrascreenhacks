The configure script is now up and running. Simply run:

$ ./configure
$ make

in the top level directory to generate the binaries. They will be in the hacks and hacks/glx directories.

If you have XScreenSaver installed by some means other than the tarball
(ex. from a Debian package), you will want to pass some options to the
configure script, like this:

$ ./configure  --with-hackdir=/usr/lib/xscreensaver --with-configdir=/usr/share/xscreensaver/config  --with-imagedir=/usr/share/xtrascreenhacks/images

Run

$ ./configure --help

for more details.

If you want the new hacks to be seen and used by the XScreenSaver daemon and its demo program, the binaries and configuration files will need to go in the same directories as the corresponding XScreenSaver files. If you're in doubt about the proper locations, search for:

fiberlamp -- put binaries here (--with-hackdir)
fiberlamp.xml -- put configuration files here (--with-configdir)

The images can go wherever you like, since they are only specified on the command line and/or within the demo program.

Once the binaries are built, give yourself write permission on the installation directories you specified and run:

$ make install

You will need to add entries to your .xscreensaver file by hand.
Open $HOME/.xscreensaver in your favorite text editor and paste
the following lines into the "programs" section:

--snip----------------
-                       "Daisy" daisy -root                                 \n\
-                     "Twinkle" twinkle -root                               \n\
-GL:                    "Flyer" flyer -root                                 \n\
-GL:               "Berlin-Uhr" berlinuhr -root                             \n\
-GL:	                 "Soma" soma -root			            \n\
-GL:	              "Skylark" skylark -root			            \n\
-GL:	              "Craters" craters -root			            \n\
-GL:	          "Psychedelic" psychedelic -root		            \n\
--snip----------------

Then run xscreensaver-demo to activate and configure the hacks. If 

If you don't have XScreensaver at all, just enjoy the hacks in a window.

If make install worked for you, type

$ make uninstall

when you no longer want the new screen hacks. The deepest directory that held the images will be removed unless something else has been put in there, but any enclosing directories will be left. The directories that held the binaries, configuration files and man pages will not be removed, because it is assumed that they still hold files from XScreenSaver.
